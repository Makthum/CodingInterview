Linked List

1) LinkedList2_1 : Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.  
2) LinkedList2_2 : Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.  
3) LinkedList2_3 : Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.  
4) LinkedList2_4 : You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a sin- gle digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list.   Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
